# Laravel Leaderboard System

This is a Laravel-based leaderboard system that tracks user activities and assigns points based on their completed activities. Users are ranked based on their total points, and the ranking is stored in the database without using `GROUP BY` or `COUNT`. The leaderboard supports filtering by **Day, Month, and Year**, searching by user ID, and recalculating ranks when new data is added.
